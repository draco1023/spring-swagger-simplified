For ApiParams wont have a swagger decorator.
Going to enhance expandResolvableParameters
For each parameter will obtain ApiParam here.
Will pas on that ApiParam when drilling in a tempBodyParameter
when properties are drilled already have logic to get the propertyBased ApiParam
Every property will have its own ApiParam, its parent Propertie's ApiParam and so on till we reach the tempBodyParameter's ApiParam.
Every property will have its ow list of ApiParam.
On the final parameter we can lopp through the list and apply each ApiParam.
key thing to achieve this will be to when building operations,
have a counter.
put the counter as an extension property in each operation
have an array where given the counter should be able to access the opration and tyhe java method
can have a cleanup at end to remove this counetr from each operation and dismantle the array.

Also must handle genericArarys in generic beans
